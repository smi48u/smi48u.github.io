## 🔎 About this Project

This site was created as a personal learning challenge. I wanted to build something that looks like it belongs to someone passionate about cybersecurity — clean, minimal, a bit hackerish.

I designed the structure, wrote the content, and used ChatGPT to assist with:
- writing responsive HTML/CSS
- improving UX for mobile
- creating Markdown-powered blog rendering
- building a clean, modern card layout
- fixing tricky bugs and edge cases

**This project is 100% mine.** Every line of code, prompt, decision and revision — even if some ideas came from AI, I made sure I understood and controlled the result.
