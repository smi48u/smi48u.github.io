# ✅ I Passed the CompTIA Security+ Exam

## 🎯 Motivation and Goals

After returning to IT, I decided to pursue the **CompTIA Security+** certification to build a solid foundation in cybersecurity and ensure my skills align with the job market.

This certification was the first step toward professional development — a way to prove to myself that I am ready to face the challenges of this dynamic industry.

My goal is to grow in the **SOC field**, where I can apply my knowledge to effectively analyze threats and manage incidents.

## 🧠 Preparation Process

I started by creating a realistic plan that fit my lifestyle and physical job (10–12h/day, Monday–Thursday).  

**Study days**: Friday, Saturday, Sunday  
**Weekdays**: ~1h review per day  

**Courses used:**  
→ Professor Messer  
→ Inside Cloud and Security  

**Website:**  
→ ExamPrepper  

**Tools:**  
→ ChatGPT for tough concepts and deeper explanations  

**Notes:** All taken in Notion  
**Strategy:** After each domain — a test + review

## 🧱 Biggest Challenges & How I Overcame Them

**Fatigue from work**: Staying consistent was tough, but the support from my coach and mentor helped me stay on track with feedback and encouragement.  

**English**: Technical material in English was difficult at first, so I started taking English lessons — which became a key part of my development.

## 📚 What I Gained: Skills & Knowledge

Security+ allowed me to:

→ Understand network protection, cryptography, risk management  
→ Analyze threats and manage incidents

These are foundational skills for a future SOC Analyst.

## 🧭 Plan for the Future
