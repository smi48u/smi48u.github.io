# 🚀 How I Built This Site

## 💭 Motivation

After deciding to pursue a career in cybersecurity, I realised I needed more than just a certificate — I needed a **visible proof of work**. A site that reflects how I think, learn and create.

I didn’t want a flashy template or generic design. I wanted something **minimal, readable, and hacker-inspired** — like a personal lab notebook.

## 🧱 Building Blocks

**VS Code** for local development  
**Markdown** for writing blog posts  
**Vanilla HTML/CSS** to keep it light  
**Font Awesome** for icons  
**ChatGPT** for pair-programming style support  
→ helped me structure the layout  
→ debugged tricky mobile bugs  
→ generated base CSS (which I then customized)

<br>

## ⚙️ How It Works

Blog entries are written in `.md` files and stored in `/blog`  
`blog.js` renders a list of posts from a predefined array  
`post.html` dynamically fetches and renders the selected `.md`  
Layout uses glowing terminal-style cards with tags, icons, and hover effects

## 🤖 Why I’m Not Hiding That I Used AI

This site is the result of **my thinking + AI consulting**, not copy-pasting.  
Every feature I included, I understood and tested.  
Just like real engineers use Stack Overflow — I used ChatGPT.  

> What matters is the **architecture, flow, and value** — and I owned all of that.
