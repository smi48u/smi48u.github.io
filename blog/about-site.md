# How I Built This Site

## 💭 Motivation

After deciding to pursue a career in cybersecurity, I realized I needed more than just a certificate — I needed a **visible proof of work**. A site that reflects how I think, learn and create.

I didn’t want a flashy template or generic design. I wanted something **minimal, readable, and hacker-inspired** — like a personal lab notebook.

## 🧱 Building Blocks

- **VS Code** for local development
- **Markdown** for writing blog posts
- **Vanilla HTML/CSS** to keep it light
- **Font Awesome** for icons
- **ChatGPT** for pair-programming style support:
  - asked how to structure the layout
  - debugged tricky mobile bugs
  - generated some base CSS (which I then customized)

---

## ⚙️ How it works

- Blog entries are written in `.md` files and stored in `/blog`
- `blog.js` renders a list of posts from a predefined list
- `post.html` dynamically fetches and renders the selected `.md`
- Blog layout uses glowing terminal-style cards with tags, icons, hover effects

## 🔐 Why I’m not hiding that I used AI

This site is the result of **my thinking + AI consulting**, not copy-pasting.
Every feature I included, I understood and tested.
Just like real engineers use Stack Overflow, I used ChatGPT.

What matters is the **architecture, flow, and value** — and I owned all of that.
