        <br><br>
        <p class="about-content">
          <strong>Iâ€™m not your typical entry-level candidate.</strong>
          <br><br>
          Over a decade ago, I graduated from a technical high school focused on networking and telecommunication. While my career path initially diverged from IT, I stayed close to technology and eventually made a full commitment to re-enter the field â€” this time with cybersecurity in focus.
          <br><br>
          While working <strong>50â€“60 hours per week</strong>, I spent evenings and weekends studying. I earned my <span class="highlight">CompTIA Security+</span> certification and built hands-on experience through labs, incident response simulations, and threat detection training.
          <br><br>
          <strong>What sets me apart is consistency.</strong> Iâ€™ve transformed my life through discipline before â€” becoming a certified personal trainer â€” and I now apply the same mindset to IT and security.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Iâ€™m currently looking for my first opportunity in IT</strong> â€” whether in <span class="highlight">support, helpdesk, or a security-focused internship</span>. Iâ€™m eager to learn, contribute, and grow in a real-world environment.
          <br><br>
          <span class="highlight">If youâ€™re looking for someone whoâ€™s reliable, coachable, and ready to bring positive energy to your team â€” feel free to reach out.</span>
