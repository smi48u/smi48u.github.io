        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <br><br>
        <p class="about-content">
          <strong style="font-size: 1.5em;">I’m not your typical entry-level candidate.</strong>
          <br><br>
          Over 12 years ago, I graduated from a <em><strong>technical high school</strong></em> with a focus on <span style="font-style: italic;">networking</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">telecommunication</span>. Since then, I’ve been continually developing my passion for <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #00f0ff;">technology and cybersecurity</span>. Although my career path initially took me in a different direction, I always stayed engaged with technology, learning and growing my skill set.
          <br><br>
          After facing some early challenges — including <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #00f0ff;">limited resources</span> during my school years and <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #00f0ff;">financial hardships</span> — I made a decisive commitment to pursue cybersecurity. I reorganized my life, refocused my efforts, and set myself on a <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #00f0ff;">clear path to success</span>.
          <br><br>
          While working <strong>50–60 hours a week</strong>, I dedicated my evenings and weekends to studying cybersecurity. I obtained my <span style="color: #00f0ff; font-weight: bold;">CompTIA Security+</span> certification and began gaining hands-on experience through <span style="color: #00f0ff;">labs</span>, incident response simulations, and threat detection projects. I’ve honed my skills in security monitoring, analysis, and response.
          <br><br>
          <strong style="font-size: 1.3em;">What sets me apart isn’t speed — it’s consistency.</strong> I am disciplined, committed, and focused on long-term growth. In the past, I transformed my physical health through sports and became a <span style="font-weight: bold;">certified personal trainer</span>. Now, I’m applying the same approach to my cybersecurity career, building my knowledge and skills <span style="font-style: italic;">step by step</span>.
          <br><br>
          <strong style="font-size: 1.3em; color: #00f0ff;">My goal is clear:</strong> to secure my first role in cybersecurity, specifically within a <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #00f0ff;">Security Operations Center (SOC)</span>, where I can apply my skills to monitor, detect, and respond to security incidents. I am fully dedicated to immersing myself in the field and growing as a professional. While I am still growing in the field, I’m someone who <strong style="color: #00f0ff;">will earn your trust and contribute meaningfully over time.</strong>
          <br><br>
          <span class="highlight" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em; color: #00f0ff;">If you’re looking for someone who is driven, dedicated, and ready to make an impact in your team — feel free to contact me.</span>
