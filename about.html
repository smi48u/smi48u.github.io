        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <br><br>
        <p class="about-content">
          <strong>Iâ€™m not your typical entry-level candidate.</strong>
          <br><br>
          Over 12 years ago, I graduated from a technical high school with a focus on networking and telecommunication. Since then, Iâ€™ve been continually developing my passion for technology and cybersecurity. Although my career path initially took me in a different direction, I always stayed engaged with technology, learning and growing my skill set.
          <br><br>
          After facing some early challenges â€” including limited resources during my school years and financial hardships â€” I made a decisive commitment to pursue cybersecurity. I reorganized my life, refocused my efforts, and set myself on a clear path to success.
          <br><br>
          While working <strong>50â€“60 hours a week </strong>, I dedicated my evenings and weekends to studying cybersecurity. I obtained my <span class="highlight">CompTIA Security+</span> certification and began gaining hands-on experience through labs, incident response simulations, and threat detection projects. Iâ€™ve honed my skills in security monitoring, analysis, and response.
          <br><br>
          <strong>What sets me apart isnâ€™t speed â€” itâ€™s consistency.</strong> I am disciplined, committed, and focused on long-term growth. In the past, I transformed my physical health through sports and became a certified personal trainer. Now, Iâ€™m applying the same approach to my cybersecurity career, building my knowledge and skills step by step.
          <br><br>
          <strong>My goal is clear:</strong> to secure my first role in cybersecurity, specifically within a Security Operations Center (SOC), where I can apply my skills to monitor, detect, and respond to security incidents. I am fully dedicated to immersing myself in the field and growing as a professional. While I am still growing in the field, Iâ€™m someone who <strong>will earn your trust and contribute meaningfully over time.</strong>
          <br><br>
          <span class="highlight">If youâ€™re looking for someone who is driven, dedicated, and ready to make an impact in your team â€” feel free to contact me.</span>
