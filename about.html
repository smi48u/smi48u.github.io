        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <br><br>
        <p class="about-content">
          <strong>I’m not your typical entry-level candidate.</strong>
          <br><br>
          Over 12 years ago, I graduated from a technical high school with a focus on networking and telecommunication.
          Life took me in a different direction —  My <em>passion for technology, hacking, and computers</em> remained strong at all times.
          Like many others, I grew up fascinated by the idea of becoming <span class="highlight">“a hacker”</span> one day.
          <br><br>
          After <strong>two failed attempts</strong> to dive into cybersecurity — one during school time (with limited access to resources),
          and another when I was going through financially tough times — I finally decided to go all in.
          I organized my life, fixed my finances, and made a promise to myself: <span class="highlight">Now or never.</span>        
<br><br>
I studied daily while working <strong>50–60 hours a week abroad</strong>, spending my weekends and evenings learning cybersecurity,
  talking to professionals, and dissecting every concept I could find.
  I passed my <span class="highlight">CompTIA Security+</span> exam and started building a practical skill set through labs, projects, and OSINT work.
  <br><br>
  <strong>What sets me apart isn’t speed — it’s consistency.</strong> I’m <em>disciplined, relentless, and willing to make sacrifices</em>.
  Years ago, I <strong>transformed my body through sport</strong> and became a certified personal trainer.
  Today, I’m doing the same with my career — <em>building it from scratch, brick by brick</em>.
<br><br>
<strong>Right now, my goal is clear:</strong> find my first role in IT or cybersecurity, return to Poland,
and fully dedicate my time to growing in this field — <em>immersing myself in the field professionally.</em>
I may not be the best yet, but I’m the kind of a person who <strong>will earn your trust over time</strong>.
<br><br>
<span class="highlight">If that remainds you of a person who you’d want to join your team — feel free to contact me.</span>
